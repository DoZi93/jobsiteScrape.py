TODO as of 2018-11-30:

NECESSARY:

- write_to_XLS(): prettify output, especially column D. Deduplicate results.

- scrape_indeed(): their search functionality is extremely limited. Maybe don't include.

- scrape_monster(): their search functionality is extremely limited. Maybe don't include.


NICE TO HAVE:

- Runtime logging: get rid of need for runlog.txt and store the runtime maybe in the respective .xlsx file.

- Add some more functions for repetitive tasks.

THINK ABOUT:

- argparse: not sure if this makes a lot sense for my personal use case.

- add abstraction layer for site parsers

- write to Google Docs to implement an API
